        <h1>Events</h1>
        <p>
            I've experienced a great many events in my two years playing the game. 
            Even if I were to only choose the most memorable ones, 
            there would still be way too many to discuss.
        </p>
        <h2>Children of Ursus</h2>

        <p>
            This was a traumatic reading experience 
            so I'm glad I don't remember much of anything from it. 
            This event details the tragic backstory of the 
            <em>Ursus Student Self-Government Group</em> and follows a similar premise 
            to the novel <em>Lord of the Flies</em>.
        </p>

        <h2>Break the Ice</h2>
        <p>
            This was more or less the last event I played. 
            Ok, so even on 8x speed it still took me a few hours to get through the story. 
            Granted, it was satisfying to finally understand the lore 
            behind one of the most powerful starter characters.

        <p>
            The story can be summarized as such:
        </p>
        <p>
            You <em>(The Doctor)</em> are going on a vacation to the remote land of <em>Kjerag</em>
            with your friend and business partner <strong>Enciodes Silverash</strong>. 
            Joining you is your bodyguard, the Elite Operator <strong>Sharp</strong>, 
            and his trainee, <strong>Aurora</strong>. 
            And of course, not everything is as it seems. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Silverash happens to be one of the biggest names in town there 
            <em>(he effectively has control of 1/3 of the population or so)</em>
            and is pushing the local government to construct a railroad 
            and open trade to the outside world. 
            You inevitably get involved in the local politcal disputes, 
            have a couple of scuffles, watch Sharp go sicko mode, 
            and eventually everything gets sorted out. 
            The people agree to bring in a new era, 
            and there is hope for the future. Fantastic.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, I did skip over A LOT of the lore about the culture and other big wigs in town, 
            but one of the great things about the Arknights community 
            is that there are plently of capable storytellers, 
            who summarize the stories of the events in short videos 
            for your viewing pleasure.
