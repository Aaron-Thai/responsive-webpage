            Arknights is pretty tough at the start of the game. 
            Yes, you do get a free starter 6* <em>(actually I even got 2 hehe) </em>
            but the amount of pull currency you have is quite stable. 
            Every week, once your account can clear <em>Annihilation 3</em>, 
            you will have about <strong>5 pulls a week</strong>.
            It's not especially spectacular, but it's definitely not too bad.
        </p>
        <p>
            Especially if you consider that a banner usually runs for two weeks, 
            and you are guaranteed a 5* after 10 pulls. 
            Basically, you'll have a chance to pull on every event banner 
            that comes out if you want to.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Limited Event banners usually they are extremely generous 
            <em>(just my opinion)</em> and will give you a free one-time 10-pull, 
            a free pull every day on the banner, 
            as well as login events that can possibly net you around 1-2 pulls every day. 
            They will also ocassionally send some free stuff to your inbox as well. 
            Overall, it's likely that you will get around 50 pulls on the banner as a f2p 
            which is likely to net you one or more copies of the featured 5* character. 
            <em>(And yes, I do have the exclusive collab character <strong>Ash</strong> 
            from Rainbow Six Siege).</em>
